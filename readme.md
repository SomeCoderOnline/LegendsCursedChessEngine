# Mega Cursed Chess Engine
Welcome to the Mega Cursed Chess Engine!
## How it Works:
If x_move_played -> play_predefined_move.
###
**The goal is to get it working with up to 3 half-moves(plies) as chess is way too complex for any more.**

# Detailed Explanation:
The project uses a text file to get perfect responses to moves. This is done via an array of openings. Then, the gaps in said openings are filled with multiple .txt files. Horrible solution to this problem please improove later future me.
